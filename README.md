visualizations of apple watch data

These files create visualizations of Apple Watch workout data from CSV's created from the "Workout - CSV Exporter" iPhone app.
The Python script filters the workouts to just the yoga workouts and provides a basic visualization.

The R file filters the data to just the yoga workouts, cleans the data, and creates detailed figures visualizing total calories burned by date and yoga workout duration. A regression model is then fitted and tested in order to predict the total calories burned in a workout using max heart rate, average heart rate, and workout duration.
